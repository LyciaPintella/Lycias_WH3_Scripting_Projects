Expanded LSG Recruitment From Ports And Elven Colonies

This mod expands port recruitment of Lothern Sea Guard to allow them to be recruited at a maximum level regular port (T5 in vanilla), or from The second level (tier 3) of the special ports located in Lothern, Copher, Dragon Isle, Marienburg, and Erengrad.

Elven Colonies also get the shielded variant at level 4, though for the minor colony that means you will need a Tier 4 Minor Building Mod.

Alarielle's True Power of Nature!

This mod allows Alarielle to boost the entire Order Tide with Power of Nature. Included cultures: High Elves (duh), Lizardmen, Grand Cathay, Kislev, Wood Elves, Bretonnia, The Empire, and the Dawi.

Tip: Ally with her and use the war coordination system to tell her to defend different regions one after another and she will do the rounds!

Also use with: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977110199]Alarielle - Power of Nature For All High Elves[/url]

[b]Note: This is included in:  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977110097]Alarielle's Global World Torment And True Power of Nature Combined[/url]. Trying to load both mods together will break something, somewhere![/b]

All I did was add hidden/disabled definitions for tier 4 minor settlements. Are you using a minor settlement mod? What happens if you load up without it? If you are using one, which one are you using? (So I can look at it).

I know this mod isn't crashing on it's own because I can run it for hours. I need to know WHICH other mod you are using so I can figure out why my change broke it.
[url=https://imgur.com/a/WPRMSy1]This is what I changed. Do you use anything else that might be mad about this?[/url]


Growth And Build Time Reduction Added To Invocation of Asuryan

This mod just makes the Invocation of Asuryan an amazing ritual for growing your lands by adding growth and build time reduction. Use it wisely!




You might find these two mods useful given the changes to siege attrition in this mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2979219631URL]AI Willing To Siege Up To 6 Turns[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2964368078]Attrition Damage Values[/url], which sets attrition fairly high once it does kick in.

AI Willing To Siege Up To 6 Turns

This mod is designed to be used with the mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976699590]Siege Attrition Tweaks[/url] (which prevents walled settlements from taking attrition for three turns) and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2964368078]Attrition Damage Values[/url], which sets attrition fairly high once it does kick in.


Earlier Mounts For All Characters

This mod reduces the level requirements for basic mounts to level one, and significantly reduces the level requirements of all other mounts. I really hate having my lords and heroes on foot; hopefully you will enjoy this too.

AI Construction Priorities Reworked T4 Minor Settlements Compatibility Submod

Use this submod in addition to the main mod if you run a tier 4 minor settlement mod. It contains logic tweaks to allow for some more building categories to be made in minor settlements since they can reach tier 4.
